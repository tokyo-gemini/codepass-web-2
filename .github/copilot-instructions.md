# Copilot Instructions

## Styling Rules
- All styles must be written using **Tailwind CSS 2**.
- Ensure compatibility with the following dependency version:
  ```json
  "tailwindcss": "npm:@tailwindcss/postcss7-compat@^2.2.17"
  ```
- Avoid using inline styles or custom CSS unless absolutely necessary.

## Additional Notes
- Follow the existing project conventions and ensure consistency across all files.
- Use utility-first classes provided by Tailwind CSS for layout and design.
